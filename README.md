# Bastion Tower Defence

Basion is a Tower Defence game in the making, using Unity.

## Objectives
Bastion is a game solely made with the intention to start diving in game development and to familiarise myself with the Unity engine. By no means is it supposed to be a full-scale game with dozens of levels.

## Roadmap
The roadmap is available on [Trello](https://trello.com/b/o02Xrj4m/bastion).
